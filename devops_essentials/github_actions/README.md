Background:
Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. GitHub Actions is a platform that allows automation of workflows, including CI, directly within GitHub repositories. GitHub Container Registry is a feature provided by GitHub to host Docker containers.

Objective:
Set up a GitHub repository to store your Dockerfile. Implement a GitHub Actions workflow to:

Automatically build your Docker image when you push changes to your repository.
Push the built Docker image to the GitHub Container Registry.

Instructions:
GitHub Repository:
Create a new GitHub repository to host your Dockerfile. You’ll use the Dockerfile from the previous task.
Clone the repository to your local machine and add your Dockerfile to it.
You’ll use this repository to test your workflow and for the MANUAL REVIEW. Provide the link to your repository on the URL form.

After that you can add the files to the Project repository specified in this task.

GitHub Actions Workflow: -Create a new file in the .github/workflows directory (you may need to create these directories). Name the file docker-image.yml.

Define a new workflow in this file. Use the on: push event to trigger the workflow on every push to the repository.
Define a job that does the following:
Checks out your repository.
Builds the Docker image.
Logs in to the GitHub Container Registry.
Pushes the Docker image to the registry.
GitHub Secrets:

For authentication with the GitHub Container Registry, you’ll need to use a token. In your repository, go to Settings > Secrets and create a new secret named CR_PAT that holds a Personal Access Token with the write:packages, read:packages, and delete:packages (if needed) scopes.
Notes:

The GitHub Container Registry requires Docker images to be tagged with a specific format. Ensure you follow the required naming conventions.
Ensure you use the GitHub Secrets appropriately in your workflow to avoid exposing sensitive information.
