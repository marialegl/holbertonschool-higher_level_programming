# docker-alpine-hello

Description:
This project is designed to immerse students in the fundamentals of containerization and orchestration using Docker, Docker Compose, and GitHub Actions. Through a series of hands-on tasks, students will gain practical experience in creating, customizing, and deploying Docker images, managing data persistence, and orchestrating simple multi-service infrastructures. The project adopts a learn-by-doing approach, encouraging students to leverage provided resources, explore solutions independently, and collaborate to overcome challenges.

Objectives:

1. Understanding Containerization: Grasp the basics of containerization by creating and customizing Docker images based on the Alpine base image.
2. Automating Workflows: Learn how to automate the build and deployment of Docker images using GitHub Actions, fostering an understanding of CI/CD principles.
3. Managing Data Persistence: Explore the concept of data persistence in Docker by working with volumes to retain data across container restarts.
4. Exploring Orchestration: Dive into basic orchestration by setting up a simple infrastructure using Docker Compose, facilitating an understanding of multi-service deployments and inter-service communication.
5. Applying Best Practices: Implement best practices in Dockerfile creation, GitHub Actions workflow configuration, and Docker Compose setup to build a solid foundation for more complex projects.
